# D-D_Mass_combat_5e

## Summary

D&D is a game played by millions, but one of the key limitations has been the implementation of mass combat. New rules from Unearthed Arcana dictacte try to expand on this, but the guidelines are rather lackluster in allowing players to have direct impacts on the battlefield, reducing damage to overall troop damage and morale. 

It's understandably ridiculous to have a single DM command anything more like 10 units for a single fight let alone hundreds, so this tool hopes to make it easier to allow DM's to do so. Ideally, players should feel powerful and impactful in mass combat (Ie. LOTR characters), but not outright invincible. 

This is a for-fun project, and I have no relation to Wizards of the Coast, other than as avid D&D 5e player.
